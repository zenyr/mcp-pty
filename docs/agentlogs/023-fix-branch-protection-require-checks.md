## Branch Protection Rule Update Completed

### Initial Approach
Checked current branch protection rules for develop branch using gh API.

### Issues Identified
PR blocked due to branch protection requiring all checks passed, but rule not properly configured.

### Solution Attempt
Updated protection rule to require status checks.

### Implementation Details
- Used gh api to set required_status_checks with strict mode and contexts including CI checks.

### Final Outcome
Develop branch now requires all status checks to pass before merge.
