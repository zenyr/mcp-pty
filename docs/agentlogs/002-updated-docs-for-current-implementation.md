# DevLog.2 - Updated Documentation for Current Implementation

**Date:** Thu Sep 25 2025  
**Focus:** Documentation synchronization with current implementation plans (@xterm/headless + bun-pty)

## Summary

Updated abstract.md and snippets.md to reflect the current implementation direction using @xterm/headless and bun-pty, based on the PoC in experiments. Verified that the to-be packages (mcp-server, pty-manager, session-manager) are well-documented in the markdown files.

## What We Did

### 1. Documentation Update Based on PoC

- Reviewed @packages/experiments/src/index.ts PoC code, which integrates bun-pty for PTY spawning and @xterm/headless for terminal emulation.
- Updated abstract.md: Modified PTY implementation section to emphasize bun-pty + @xterm/headless usage, including ANSI sequence handling and serialize addon for screen capture.
- Updated snippets.md: Rewrote PTY Manager code snippet to use bun-pty.spawn, @xterm/headless Terminal, and SerializeAddon, mirroring the PoC structure (e.g., getScreen with stripAnsi option, getStatus, kill methods).

### 2. Package Status Verification

- Checked current state of packages/mcp-server, pty-manager, session-manager src/index.ts files.
- Confirmed they are in to-be state with TODO comments for STDIO/HTTP transport, PTY management, and session lifecycle.
- Verified that md files adequately document the planned interfaces, classes, and integration points for these packages.

## Files Worked On

- `docs/abstract.md`: Updated PTY implementation section.
- `docs/snippets.md`: Rewrote PTY Manager code snippet.
- `packages/experiments/src/index.ts`: Referenced for PoC patterns.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts`, `packages/pty-manager/src/index.ts`, `packages/session-manager/src/index.ts`: Reviewed for current state.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Core Packages**: Begin implementing mcp-server, pty-manager, and session-manager based on updated snippets.
2. **MCP Integration**: Integrate bun-pty and @xterm/headless into the main MCP server logic.
3. **Testing**: Test the updated code snippets in a real environment, ensuring compatibility with Bun and TypeScript strict mode.
4. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep md files synchronized as implementation progresses.
5. **CI/CD Setup**: Add build/check scripts for the packages to ensure type safety.

## Key Findings

- Md files were outdated compared to the current PoC direction; updates align them with @xterm/headless + bun-pty approach.
- PoC code provides a solid foundation for PTY handling, including ANSI stripping and headless terminal emulation.
- To-be packages are well-planned in docs, with clear separation of concerns (MCP layer, PTY control, session management).
- Documentation now supports TUI capabilities fully, including real-time output and interactive commands.

## Additional Updates (Feedback Incorporation)

**Date:** Thu Sep 25 2025  
**Focus:** Incorporated user feedback from // comments in abstract.md and snippets.md, and switched session ID generation from ULID to nanoid for brevity.

### Changes Made

- **abstract.md Updates**:
  - Revised resource descriptions to emphasize subprocess management within sessions (e.g., `pty://sessions/list` now focuses on listing subprocesses in the current session).
  - Adjusted tool names: Fixed `start_pty`, `kill_pty` as core tools; `list_pty`, `read_pty` only when Resources are unsupported.

- **snippets.md Updates**:
  - Modified `PTYSession` interface: Changed `ptyProcess?` to `ptyProcesses: Map<string, Subprocess>` for multi-instance support; removed `outputBuffer` to enforce real-time querying.
  - Switched session ID generation from `crypto.randomUUID()`/ULID to nanoid for shorter, URL-safe IDs.
  - Converted `getStatus()` to a getter `get status()`.
  - Moved `resourcesEnabled` check into `setupResources` and `setupTools` methods for better encapsulation.
  - Renamed tool `activate_pty_tools` to `enable_subprocess_management` for clarity in subprocess info provision when Resources are unavailable.

### Rationale

- Feedback addressed session isolation and subprocess focus, aligning with MCP client constraints.
- nanoid chosen for its compactness and randomness, better suited for IDs than ULID in this context.
