# Core PTY Foundation Implementation

## Feature

Established Bun-native PTY infrastructure with bun-pty + @xterm/headless, validated TUI capabilities, and implemented core PTY Manager with type-safe session management.

### Phase 1-3

**bun-pty Validation & PTY Manager Implementation**

Transitioned from basic spawn experiments to full PTY support using bun-pty library. Confirmed interactive terminal capabilities with ANSI escape sequences, real-time updates, and UTF-8 input (Korean tested). Successfully integrated @xterm/headless for headless terminal emulation with SerializeAddon for screen capture.

Implemented complete PTY Manager package with MCP-independent design:
- Strong TypeScript types (PtyStatus, PtyInstance, PtySession)
- PtyProcess class: bun-pty spawning, @xterm/headless integration, ANSI sequence handling
- PtyManager class: sessionId-based multi-instance management with CRUD interface
- Session lifecycle management (initialize → active → terminate)
- Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

Updated documentation (abstract.md, snippets.md) to reflect bun-pty + @xterm/headless approach with nanoid-based session IDs for URL-safe brevity.

### Key Changes

- Integrated bun-pty@0.3.2 as native alternative to node-pty
- Tested interactive TUI (man ls with search, scrolling)
- Implemented PtyProcess with Terminal emulation and screen serialization
- Designed sessionId/processId-based type safety model
- Updated MD documentation to align with PoC patterns
- Applied strict TypeScript (strict=true, noImplicitAny)
- Switched session ID generation to nanoid for compactness

### Outcome

Established production-ready PTY foundation with:
- Working bun-pty integration for TUI support
- Type-safe session and process management
- Full ANSI/UTF-8 support validated
- Tests passing (unit, type-check, lint, build)
- Ready for MCP Resources/Tools dual-mode integration
