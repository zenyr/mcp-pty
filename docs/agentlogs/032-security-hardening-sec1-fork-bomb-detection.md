# AgentLog: Security Hardening Phase 6.2 - sec-1 Fork Bomb Detection

## Summary
Implemented sec-1 of Phase 6.2 Security Hardening: added dangerous pattern detection for fork bombs in the normalize-commands package. This prevents execution of recursive fork bomb commands that could exhaust system resources.

## Decisions Made
- **Pattern Detection Approach**: Used string-based regex matching before AST parsing for efficiency and simplicity
- **Regex Pattern**: `:\(\)\s*\{\s*:\s*\|\s*:&\s*\}\s*;\s*:/` to match fork bomb variants with flexible whitespace
- **Integration Point**: Added check in `normalizeCommand` function before bash-parser execution
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing dangerous pattern detection (consent bypass via env var)
- **Test Activation**: Re-enabled previously skipped test case

## Issues Encountered
- Initial test was marked as `skip` due to perceived complexity of AST-based detection
- Needed to ensure pattern catches common fork bomb variants without false positives

## Solutions Implemented
- Simple string regex detection proved sufficient for this pattern
- Test passes with exact match on `:(){ :|:& };:`
- Maintains performance by checking before expensive AST parsing
- Follows existing security pattern of throwing errors with consent bypass option

## Impact
- Prevents resource exhaustion attacks via fork bombs
- Minimal performance impact (string check before parsing)
- Consistent with other dangerous pattern validations
- Test coverage ensures reliability

## Next Steps
- Continue with remaining sec-2 to sec-15 critical security fixes
- Consider additional dangerous patterns if identified
