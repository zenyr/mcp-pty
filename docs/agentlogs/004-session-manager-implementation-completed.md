# DevLog.3 - Session Manager Implementation Completed

**Date:** Fri Sep 26 2025  
**Focus:** Complete implementation of session-manager package with full type safety and testing

## Summary

Successfully implemented the session-manager package from scratch, establishing the foundation for MCP client's session lifecycle management. The package provides isolated session handling with PTY binding capabilities, idle monitoring, and graceful shutdown procedures. All code is fully typed, linted, and tested with Bun.

## What We Did

### 1. Project Setup and Dependencies

- Configured package.json with essential dependencies (ulid, consola, eslint, etc.) using `bun --cwd=packages/session-manager add`
- Optimized tsconfig.json for strict TypeScript settings (target=ES2022, module=ESNext)
- Set up ESLint v9 configuration with eslint.config.js for modern linting rules
- Added Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting

### 2. Type System Implementation

- Defined comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`:
  - `SessionId` (ULID-based string type)
  - `SessionStatus` union type (initializing → active → idle → terminating → terminated)
  - `Session` interface with metadata and PTY bindings
  - `SessionEvent` discriminated union for event handling
  - `PtyInstanceReference` for PTY process ID mapping

### 3. Core SessionManager Class

- Implemented `SessionManager` class with full CRUD operations:
  - `createSession()`: ULID-based ID generation
  - `getSession()`, `getAllSessions()`: Session retrieval
  - `updateStatus()`: State transition handling
  - `deleteSession()`: Session cleanup
- Added PTY binding management:
  - `addPty()`/`removePty()`: 1:N session-to-PTY mapping
  - Automatic lastActivity updates on state changes

### 4. Lifecycle Management

- Implemented state machine with proper transitions
- Added idle session monitoring with 5-minute timeout
- Created `startMonitoring()`/`stopMonitoring()` for background cleanup
- Implemented `terminateSession()` with graceful state progression

### 5. Event System and Integration

- Built event-driven architecture with `addEventListener()`/`removeEventListener()`
- Event types: created, statusChanged, ptyBound, ptyUnbound, terminated
- Integrated consola for structured logging
- Designed for future MCP server integration (events can be broadcast via SSE)

### 6. Graceful Shutdown

- Implemented `cleanup()` method for complete resource release
- Proper Timer cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Session termination with state validation
- Event listener cleanup

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Wrote comprehensive unit tests (15 test cases) covering:
  - Session CRUD operations
  - PTY binding/unbinding
  - State transitions and monitoring
  - Cleanup procedures
- All tests pass with 29 assertions
- ESLint and TypeScript strict checks passing
- No any types or ts-ignore used

### 8. Documentation and Kanban Management

- Maintained kanban.md for task tracking
- Moved completed tasks to Done section as implementation progressed
- Ensured separation of concerns (no direct MCP or transport layer coupling)

## Files Worked On

- `packages/session-manager/package.json`: Dependencies and scripts
- `packages/session-manager/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `packages/session-manager/eslint.config.js`: Linting rules
- `packages/session-manager/.prettierrc`: Code formatting
- `packages/session-manager/src/types/index.ts`: Type definitions
- `packages/session-manager/src/utils/ulid.ts`: ID generation utility
- `packages/session-manager/src/index.ts`: Main SessionManager implementation
- `packages/session-manager/src/__tests__/session-manager.test.ts`: Test suite
- `packages/session-manager/kanban.md`: Task tracking
- `AGENTS.md`: Updated with bun --cwd usage patterns

## Next Steps

1. **MCP Server Integration**: Begin implementing mcp-server package to bridge SessionManager with MCP protocol
2. **PTY Manager Enhancement**: Integrate session-manager with pty-manager for full PTY lifecycle
3. **Transport Layer Implementation**: Add stdio and streaming-HTTP support in mcp-server
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete flow from MCP client to PTY execution
5. **Documentation Sync**: Update abstract.md and snippets.md with actual implementation details
6. **Performance Optimization**: Add metrics and monitoring for session usage

## Key Findings

- Bun's Timer handling required careful type management for setInterval/clearInterval
- Event-driven architecture provides clean separation for future SSE integration
- ULID provides excellent time-sortable IDs for session tracking
- Strict TypeScript + ESLint caught several potential runtime issues during development
- Memory-based session storage is sufficient for initial implementation; can be extended to persistent storage later
- The isolated design allows session-manager to remain MCP-agnostic while supporting future integrations

## Additional Notes

- Followed KISS/SOLID principles throughout implementation
- All code is Bun-native, avoiding Node.js fallbacks
- Comprehensive TSDoc comments added for future API documentation
- Package is ready for monorepo integration with @pkgs/\* imports
