# 019-fix-release-workflow-yaml-indentation

## Problem
- Recent deployment failures due to YAML parsing errors in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Inconsistent indentation causing workflow execution failures
- Push-triggered runs failing with "workflow file issue" error

## Solution
- Corrected YAML indentation to standard 2-space format
- Ensured all steps have consistent indentation
- Verified workflow_dispatch trigger remains intact

## Impact
- Fixes workflow parsing errors
- Allows manual release workflow to execute properly
- Prevents future deployment failures from YAML syntax issues

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Fixed indentation for all steps

## Testing
- YAML syntax validated locally
- No functional changes to workflow logic
