# DevLog.1 - Tested Bun PTY Implementation

**Date:** Thu Sep 25 2025  
**Focus:** Experimental validation of Bun-native PTY for TUI applications

## Summary

Successfully transitioned from basic spawn experiments to full PTY support using `bun-pty` library. Confirmed interactive terminal capabilities with ANSI escape sequences and real-time updates.

## What We Did

### 1. Korean Input Experiment (`comparison.ts`)

- Modified spawn/shell comparison to test UTF-8 Korean input
- Command: `echo 안녕하세요` with backspace manipulation and enter
- Captured stdout using `TextDecoder`, verified ANSI code preservation
- Logs: `comparison.spawn.log`, `comparison.shell.log`, `comparison.tui.log`

### 2. Initial TUI Testing

- Extended `comparison.ts` for `man ls` testing with scrolling/search inputs
- Identified limitations in non-PTY mode (no real-time screen updates)
- Experimented with xterm.js integration in `xterm.ts`

### 3. Bun-PTY Integration

- Installed `bun-pty@0.3.2` as native Bun PTY alternative to node-pty
- Reviewed README for correct API usage (`spawn()`, `onData()`, `write()`)
- Updated `xterm.ts` to use bun-pty instead of direct spawn

## What We're Doing

- Successfully integrated bun-pty for TUI support
- Tested `man ls` with interactive search (/SYNOPSIS)
- Confirmed PTY enables scrolling, real-time updates, and command interaction
- Log: `xterm.tui.log`, `xterm.ansi.log`

## Files Worked On

- `src/experiments/comparison.ts`: Spawn/shell comparisons, Korean input, basic TUI
- `src/experiments/xterm.ts`: xterm.js + bun-pty integration for PTY TUI

## Next Steps

1. **MCP Integration**: Apply bun-pty to main mcp-pty implementation
2. **Session Management**: Implement UUID-based session IDs, lifecycle tracking
3. **Dual Interface**: Support Resources mode (pty:// URIs) and Tools fallback
4. **Process Management**: PTY spawning, stream piping, output buffering (1MB max)
5. **Security & Performance**: Input sanitization, process isolation, benchmarks (<100ms session creation, <10MB/session memory)
6. **Platform Support**: Shell detection (darwin: zsh), graceful shutdown

## Key Findings

- Bun.spawn alone insufficient for interactive TUI; PTY required for real terminal emulation
- bun-pty provides clean Bun-native API without node-pty dependencies
- UTF-8 and ANSI sequences handled correctly in PTY mode
- Ready for MCP Resources/Tools dual-mode implementation
