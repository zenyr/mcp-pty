# HTTP Session Recovery E2E Test Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Issue**: Validate HTTP session recovery mechanism works end-to-end

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive E2E test validating HTTP session recovery works correctly when:
1. Server is killed and restarted
2. Client receives 404 response (session not found)
3. Client auto-updates sessionId from response header
4. Client successfully reconnects and resumes operation

## Problem Statement

Previous investigation (agentlog #033) identified that HTTP session recovery mechanism was implemented at the transport level but hadn't been validated end-to-end with actual server restart scenarios.

Key question: **Does the full recovery flow work in practice?**

## Solution

Created clean E2E test architecture:

### Files Added

**1. `http-session-recovery-server.ts` (test helper)**
- Standalone server script for tests to spawn
- Accepts port argument: `bun src/__tests__/http-session-recovery-server.ts 6425`
- Clean separation of server logic from test logic
- No absolute paths embedded in test code

**2. `http-session-recovery-e2e.test.ts` (main test)**
- Encapsulates full recovery scenario in single `bun test`
- Spawns server as subprocess (not in test thread)
- Validates 3 distinct phases:
  - **Phase 1**: Normal polling (2 successful polls)
  - **Phase 2**: Server disconnection (detected, poll fails)
  - **Phase 3**: Server restart & recovery (404 → reconnect → success)

### Test Phases Detailed

```
Phase 1: Normal Operation
├─ Start server on port 6425
├─ Client connects (gets sessionId: 01K8626A...)
├─ Poll 1: ✓ Got 5 tools
└─ Poll 2: ✓ Got 5 tools

Phase 2: Server Shutdown
├─ Kill server process
├─ Poll 3: ✗ Unable to connect (network error)
└─ Server fully stopped

Phase 3: Server Restart + Recovery
├─ Start new server process
├─ Poll 4: ✗ Got HTTP 404 (session not found)
│   └─ Client triggers auto-reconnect
├─ Reconnect: New sessionId acquired (01K8626B...)
└─ Poll 5: ✓ Got 5 tools with new session
```

## Key Validation Points

✅ **404 Mechanism Works**
- Server correctly returns 404 when session not found in memory
- Response includes `mcp-session-id` header with new sessionId

✅ **SDK Auto-Update Works**
- MCP SDK client automatically extracts new sessionId from 404 response
- Updates internal `transport.sessionId` without explicit code handling

✅ **Full Recovery Works**
- Client successfully reconnects after receiving 404
- Can resume operations (listTools) with new session
- No manual retry logic needed (SDK handles it)

✅ **Clean Test Architecture**
- Server spawned as subprocess (not in test thread)
- No absolute paths hardcoded
- Uses relative paths and `import.meta.url` for portability
- Proper cleanup in afterAll hook

## Test Results

```
[TEST] ✓ Phase 1: Normal polling works
[TEST] ✓ Phase 2: Server disconnection detected
[TEST] ✓ Phase 3: Client recovered and operational
[TEST] Final: 3 successes, 2 failures

(pass) HTTP session recovery: server restart with client reconnection [1178.93ms]
 1 pass
 0 fail
 7 expect() calls
```

## Important Findings

### Session IDs Are Correctly Isolated

When server restarts:
- Old sessionId (`01K8626A...`) becomes invalid (stored only in client memory)
- Server creates new sessionId (`01K8626B...`) when client reconnects
- Session data is NOT preserved (as expected - new server process has clean memory)

### Error Handling Flow

The recovery works because:
1. **Poll attempt with old sessionId** → HTTP 404 response
2. **MCP SDK sees 404** → Extracts new sessionId from response header
3. **SDK auto-updates** → `transport.sessionId = newSessionId`
4. **Subsequent operations** → Use new sessionId, succeed

### No 400 Errors in E2E

Earlier investigation showed 400 errors in specific scenarios. These don't occur in this E2E because:
- There's always a delay between server kill and next poll attempt (5s intervals)
- Server has time to be fully restarted before client retries
- Initial connection (GET) goes through and creates new session, then POST succeeds

## Code Quality

- ✅ No `any` types
- ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces (PollResult)
- ✅ Async/await (no callbacks)
- ✅ Error handling with try/catch
- ✅ Type guards where needed
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Cleanup

Removed test scaffolding files that were created during investigation:
- ❌ `http-server-simple.ts`
- ❌ `polling-client.ts`
- ❌ `test-utils.ts`
- ✅ Kept only: `http-session-recovery-e2e.test.ts` + `http-session-recovery-server.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Run `bun test` to include in CI
2. Consider testing other failure scenarios:
   - Network timeout recovery
   - Partial message handling
   - Multiple concurrent clients
3. Review deferred initialization logic in `transports/index.ts` (may have edge cases)

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| `src/transports/index.ts` | Enhanced error logging | Debug 400 errors (already present) |
| `src/__tests__/http-session-recovery-e2e.test.ts` | NEW | Main E2E test |
| `src/__tests__/http-session-recovery-server.ts` | NEW | Test server helper |

## Conclusion

✅ **HTTP session recovery mechanism is fully functional end-to-end**

The implementation correctly handles the critical scenario: when a server restarts and client has a stale sessionId, the server returns 404 with new sessionId, and the client automatically recovers and continues operation.
