## README Update with Latest Features and Config Completed

### Initial Approach
Started with basic README structure, added recent features incrementally.

### Issues Identified
README lacked comprehensive feature list, API documentation was incomplete, missing recent additions like normalize-commands integration, HTTP reconnection, list tool exitCode.

### Documentation Enhancement Attempt
Added Features section and expanded API docs, but structure was inconsistent with project standards.

### Switched to Comprehensive Rewrite
Rewrote entire Features and API Documentation sections following project documentation standards.

### Implementation Details
- Added Features section with 9 key capabilities
- Enhanced MCP Resources with detailed descriptions
- Updated MCP Tools with parameter specs and fallback modes
- Verified configuration and usage sections
- Maintained English documentation standard

### TDD Process
- No tests for documentation, relied on manual review
- Verified all recent implementations (005-011) included
- Confirmed API accuracy against implementation

### Final Outcome
README now fully documents all features, ready for user adoption. Covers 11 recent implementations with clear API guidance.
