# Fix Session Connect Bug

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Agent:** GLM-4.6  
**Status:** âœ… Completed

## Problem

HTTP transport was experiencing "Server not initialized" errors after initial connection. Sessions were being deleted on every request completion, causing subsequent requests to fail with session not found errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Session Deletion on Request Completion**: The `res.on("close")` handler was deleting sessions regardless of whether the connection completed successfully or encountered an error
2. **Improper Session State Persistence**: Sessions were not being stored immediately after creation/reconnection
3. **Notification Handling Issues**: JSON-RPC notifications were not being processed through the transport, causing session state inconsistencies
4. **Terminated Session Reconnection**: Previous fix addressed reconnection to terminated sessions

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Immediate Session Storage
```typescript
session = { server, transport };
sessions.set(sessionId, session); // Ensure session is stored immediately
```

### 2. Connection-Error-Only Cleanup
```typescript
res.on("close", () => {
  const transportSessionId = session?.transport.sessionId;
  if (transportSessionId && res.writableEnded && !res.writableFinished) {
    // Only cleanup on connection errors, not on normal request completion
    const ptyManager = sessionManager.getPtyManager(transportSessionId);
    ptyManager?.dispose();
    sessionManager.updateStatus(transportSessionId, "terminated");
    sessions.delete(transportSessionId);
  }
});
```

### 3. Proper Notification Handling
```typescript
// Process notifications through the transport to maintain session state
await session.transport.handleRequest(req, res, jsonBody);
const response = await toFetchResponse(res);
```

### 4. Terminated Session Check (Previous Fix)
```typescript
if (existingSession && existingSession.status !== "terminated") {
  // Reconnect to existing session
} else {
  // Create new session
}
```

## Testing

- Verified session persistence across multiple requests
- Confirmed tool listing functionality works correctly after initial connection
- Tested reconnection logic with terminated sessions
- All existing tests continue to pass (mcp-pty: 57 tests, session-manager: 16 tests)

## Impact

- Fixed "Server not initialized" errors in HTTP transport
- Improved session lifecycle management
- Enhanced reconnection reliability
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Files Changed

- `packages/mcp-pty/src/transports/index.ts` - Session management fixes
