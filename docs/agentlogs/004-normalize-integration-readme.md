## Normalize-Commands Integration, Test Enhancement, and Documentation Completed

### Phase 010-012: Integration & Enhancement

**Phase 010 - normalize-commands Integration**: Replaced simple string split parsing in PtyProcess with bash-parser based normalizeCommand for accurate handling of pipelines, redirections, logical operators. Added @pkgs/normalize-commands dependency, modified init() to use JSON.parse(normalizeCommand()), included fallback error handling.

**Phase 011 - Test Enhancement**: Fixed environment variable assignment parsing (`DEBUG=1 echo foo` now correctly triggers shell execution). Enhanced `requiresShellExecution` to detect prefix assignments. Expanded tests: `foo --cwd=1 bar baz`, `foo bar=1 baz`, `VAR1=1 VAR2=2 echo hello` cases. Refactored 24 tests to data-driven format, eliminating duplication.

**Phase 012 - Documentation**: Comprehensive README rewrite. Added 9 key features, enhanced MCP Resources/Tools sections with parameter specs and fallback modes. Verified all 11 recent implementations (005-012) included with accurate API guidance.

### Key Changes
- Integrated normalizeCommand into pty-manager for complex command parsing
- Fixed environment variable detection to force shell execution when needed
- Improved test coverage: added 6 new test cases, refactored to DRY patterns
- Documented all features and API with implementation accuracy

### Outcome
- PtyProcess now handles pipelines, redirections, logical operators correctly
- normalize-commands properly detects environment variable assignments
- Test suite: 72 tests passing (pty-manager), 24 tests passing (normalize-commands, data-driven)
- README fully documented all features, ready for user adoption
