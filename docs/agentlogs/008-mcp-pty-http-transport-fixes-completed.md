## MCP-PTY HTTP Transport Fixes Completed

### Initial Approach
MCP server with HTTP transport using StreamableHTTPServerTransport for client reconnection support.

### Issues Identified
- Session disconnect disposed entire session including sessionId, preventing reconnection
- DELETE /mcp endpoint disposed entire session, blocking proper reconnection
- Client reconnection created new sessionId, causing MCP protocol session mismatch
- PTYs remained undisposed on disconnect, potential resource leaks
- `notifications/initialized` messages returned 400 Bad Request errors

### Session Reuse Solution Adopted
Modified HTTP transport to reuse sessionId on reconnection, dispose PTYs on disconnect but preserve session for reconnection.

### Implementation Details
- **Session Continuity**: Updated res.on("close") to dispose PTYs but keep session in sessionManager
- **DELETE Endpoint Fix**: Modified DELETE /mcp to dispose PTYs only, preserve session for reconnection
- **Reconnection Logic**: Added sessionManager.getSession() check, reuses existing sessionId with new transport/server instance
- **Notification Handling**: Added detection and handling of MCP notifications (id-less messages) in transport layer
- **Error Handling**: JSON parsing errors return 400 with descriptive message

### TDD Process
- All existing tests passed (26/26)
- No new tests added; relies on existing transport integration tests
- Verified via PM2 restart, log analysis, and curl testing

### Final Outcome
- Clients can reconnect using same sessionId without 400 errors
- PTY resources properly cleaned on disconnect while preserving session continuity
- MCP notifications handled correctly with 200 OK responses
- Server ready for stable client reconnection and tool/resource operations
