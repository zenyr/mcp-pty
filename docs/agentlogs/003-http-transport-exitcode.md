## HTTP Transport & ExitCode Implementation

### Phase 1: List Tool ExitCode

Updated PtyInfoSchema with exitCode field and modified list handler to include exitCode (null for running, number for terminated) per PTY.

- Added exitCode: z.number().nullable() to schema
- Modified list handler to return pty.getExitCode() for each PTY
- TDD approach: tests updated first, confirmed failure, implementation verified (26/26 tests pass)

### Phase 2: HTTP Transport Session Reuse

Fixed client reconnection by preserving sessionId across disconnect events.

- Session disconnect now disposes only PTYs, preserves session in sessionManager
- DELETE /mcp endpoint disposes PTYs only, keeps session for reconnection
- Reconnection reuses existing sessionId with new transport/server instance
- Added sessionManager.getSession() check for reconnection logic

### Phase 3: Notification Handling

Resolved MCP protocol notification errors (id-less messages returning 400 Bad Request).

- Added detection and handling of MCP notifications in transport layer
- JSON parsing errors return 400 with descriptive message
- Notifications now return 200 OK responses

### Key Changes

- Maintains session continuity while cleaning up PTY resources on disconnect
- ExitCode properly typed and included in list tool responses
- MCP protocol compliance with notification handling
- All 26 existing tests pass; integration verified via HTTP transport tests

### Outcome

Clients reconnect using same sessionId without errors. PTY resources properly disposed while preserving session state. MCP notifications handled correctly. HTTP transport ready for stable reconnection and full tool/resource operations.
