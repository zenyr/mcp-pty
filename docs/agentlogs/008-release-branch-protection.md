## Release & Protection Workflow Stabilization

### Phase 1: AgentLogs Cleanup
Identified duplicate sequential numbering in agentlogs directory (014, 017 duplicates). Renamed all files to sequential 001-022 for consistent tracking.

### Phase 2: YAML Indentation Fix
Fixed `.github/workflows/release.yml` indentation errors causing deployment failures. Corrected to standard 2-space format across all steps while preserving workflow_dispatch trigger.

### Phase 3: Branch Protection
Enabled GitHub branch protection for develop branch requiring PR review before merge and status checks for CI workflows.

### Key Changes
- Renumbered agentlog files for clarity (015-022)
- Fixed YAML parsing errors in release workflow
- Configured branch protection rules to enforce PR review process
- Prevented accidental direct commits to develop

### Outcome
Release workflow now executes properly with correct YAML syntax. Develop branch protected with mandatory code review via PRs. All agentlog files uniquely numbered.
