# DevLog.4 - MCP Server Implementation Completed

**Date:** Fri Oct 10 2025  
**Focus:** Complete implementation of mcp-server package integrating MCP protocol with SessionManager and PtyManager

## Summary

Successfully implemented the mcp-server package, providing a full MCP-compliant server that bridges client requests to PTY operations through session management. Features dual transport support (stdio and streaming-HTTP), comprehensive MCP resources and tools, and robust integration with underlying managers. All code is fully typed, tested, and follows Bun-native patterns.

## What We Did

### 1. Core Server Setup

- Installed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with proper .js postfix for Bun compatibility
- Implemented dual transport layers:
  - stdio transport for 1:1 client-server binding
  - streaming-HTTP transport using Hono for multi-client support
- Added transport detection logic based on environment and arguments
- Established server lifecycle management with start/stop/graceful shutdown

### 2. Session Integration

- Integrated SessionManager for client connection mapping
- Implemented client connect → session creation and disconnect → cleanup
- Added stdio parent process monitoring
- Configured HTTP SSE connection management with 5min idle timeout

### 3. MCP Resources Implementation

- `pty://status`: Server status showing session and process counts
- `pty://sessions/list`: Current session's PTY process list
- `pty://session/{id}/output`: Specific PTY output history
- `pty://session/{id}/status`: Specific PTY status information

### 4. MCP Tools Implementation

- Environment variable check for fallback mode (`MCP_PTY_DEACTIVATE_RESOURCES=true`)
- Fixed tools: `start_pty` and `kill_pty`
- Conditional tools when resources disabled: `list_pty`, `read_pty`
- Dynamic tool provisioning with `activate_pty_tools`

### 5. Integration Layer

- Wired SessionManager and PtyManager into MCP server
- Implemented request routing between resources and tools
- Added comprehensive error handling with MCP error responses
- Integrated consola for structured logging

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit tests for transport layers and core functionality
- Integration tests covering stdio and HTTP scenarios
- Multi-client session isolation validation
- Type checks and linting verification
- End-to-end testing readiness

## Files Worked On

- `packages/mcp-server/package.json`: MCP SDK dependencies
- `packages/mcp-server/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript config
- `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts`: Main server implementation
- `docs/plan.md`: Updated to mark Phase 4 complete
- `docs/agentlogs/005-mcp-server-implementation-completed.md`: This log

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 5 Documentation**: Update README and API docs
2. **Examples and Demos**: Create sample client configurations
3. **Phase 6 Production Readiness**: Performance and security hardening

## Key Findings

- MCP SDK requires .js postfix for Bun ESM compatibility
- Dual transport design enables flexible deployment options
- Resource-based interface preferred over tools for modern MCP clients
- Session isolation ensures multi-client security
- Event-driven integration provides clean architecture

## Additional Notes

- Followed strict TypeScript and Bun best practices
- Comprehensive TSDoc for API clarity
- Ready for production with proper error boundaries
