# 020-enable-branch-protection-for-develop

## Problem
- Direct pushes to develop branch are currently allowed
- Need to enforce code review process through pull requests
- Prevent accidental direct commits to develop

## Solution
- Enable branch protection for develop branch
- Require pull requests before merging
- Add status checks for CI workflows
- Restrict direct pushes to require PR approval

## Impact
- Forces all changes to go through PR review process
- Improves code quality and collaboration
- Prevents direct pushes that bypass review

## Files Changed
- Branch protection rules via GitHub API

## Testing
- Verify branch protection is active
- Test that direct pushes are blocked
- Confirm PR workflow still works
