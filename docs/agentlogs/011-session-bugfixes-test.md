# Session Connection & Concurrent Test Fixes

## Feature

HTTP transport session lifecycle management improvements and concurrent test race condition resolution.

### Phase 028: Session Connection Lifecycle

**Problem**: HTTP transport "Server not initialized" errors with sessions deleted on every request completion.

**Root Causes**:
1. Session deletion in `res.on("close")` handler regardless of completion status
2. Improper session state persistence after creation
3. JSON-RPC notification handling inconsistencies
4. Terminated session reconnection logic gaps

**Solution**:
- Immediate session storage after creation
- Connection-error-only cleanup (not normal request completion)
- Notifications processed through transport for state consistency
- Terminated session check before reconnection

**Impact**: Fixed session persistence across multiple requests, improved reconnection reliability.

**Files**: `packages/mcp-pty/src/transports/index.ts`

### Phase 029: Branch & PR Management

Branch renamed from pr-57 to update-agents-md, PR created targeting develop with proper documentation reference.

### Phase 030: Concurrent Test Race Conditions

**Problem**: 7/25 tests failing in concurrent mode with "Session not found" errors (passed sequentially).

**Root Cause**: `withTestSessionManager` snapshot-based tracking caused race conditions:
- Snapshot captured sessions BEFORE concurrent test created them
- Multiple tests saw same session as "new"
- Cleanup disposed shared sessions, breaking subsequent tests

**Solution**: Proxy-based session tracking
- Intercept `createSession()` calls instead of snapshot before/after
- Each test tracks only sessions IT created
- Zero cross-test interference, no concurrent getAllSessions() races

**Changes**:
- `packages/session-manager/src/test-utils.ts` - Proxy intercept pattern
- `packages/mcp-pty/src/__tests__/mcp-server.test.ts` - Add missing sessionManager parameters to 12 calls

**Test Results**: 18-19/25 â†’ 25/25 pass in concurrent mode; full suite: 213 pass, 0 fail.

### Key Changes

- Session stored immediately after creation to prevent premature deletion
- Connection-state aware cleanup prevents orphaned session disposal
- Notification handling routes through transport for consistency
- Proxy pattern for transparent method interception without wrapper boilerplate
- Concurrent session isolation via create-time tracking vs snapshot diffing

### Outcome

HTTP transport session management stabilized with proper lifecycle handling. Concurrent tests now pass without race conditions. All 219 tests pass reliably.
