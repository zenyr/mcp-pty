**Agent:** TypeScript Expert  
**PR:** [Link to be added]

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive security hardening measures for the MCP PTY system to prevent various attack vectors and resource exhaustion scenarios.

## Changes Made

### Environment Variable Sanitization (sec-7)
- Added `sanitizeEnv` function in `packages/pty-manager/src/process.ts`
- Removes dangerous environment variables: `LD_PRELOAD`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_PATH`, `GEM_PATH`, `PERL5LIB`, `RUBYLIB`, `CLASSPATH`, `PATH`
- Applied to all PTY spawn operations to prevent library injection attacks

### Sh -c Bypass Prevention (sec-2/3)
- Enhanced `validateCommandAST` in `packages/normalize-commands/src/index.ts`
- Added recursive validation for `sh -c` command arguments
- Parses and validates the inner command string to prevent bypass attacks like `sh -c "rm -rf /"`

### Resource Limits Implementation
- **PTY Count Limit (sec-10):** Added `MAX_PTY_PER_SESSION = 10` in `packages/pty-manager/src/manager.ts`
- Throws error when attempting to create 11th PTY in a session
- **Execution Timeout (sec-11):** Added `execTimeout` option to `PtyOptions`
- Implements activity-based timeout reset to prevent hanging processes

### Testing
- Added PTY count limit test in `packages/pty-manager/src/__tests__/security.test.ts`
- Added sh -c bypass tests in `packages/normalize-commands/src/__tests__/index.test.ts`
- All tests pass with comprehensive coverage

## Impact

- **Security:** Prevents environment variable injection, command bypass, and resource exhaustion attacks
- **Stability:** Limits resource usage per session to prevent DoS scenarios
- **Compatibility:** Maintains backward compatibility while adding security layers

## Next Steps

- Update documentation with security features
- Consider additional hardening measures for post-v1.0
- Monitor for any edge cases in production use
