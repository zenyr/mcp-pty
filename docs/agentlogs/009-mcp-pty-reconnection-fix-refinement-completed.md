## MCP-PTY Reconnection Fix Refinement Completed

### Initial Approach
DELETE /mcp disposed entire session, preventing proper reconnection.

### Issues Identified
- DELETE endpoint called disposeSession(), removing session from sessionManager
- Reconnection treated as stale session, created new sessionId
- MCP protocol session mismatch caused 400 errors

### Session Preservation Solution Adopted
Modified DELETE endpoint to dispose PTYs only, preserve session in sessionManager for reconnection.

### Implementation Details
- Updated DELETE /mcp to call ptyManager?.dispose() and updateStatus("terminated")
- Removed disposeSession() call to keep session available for reconnection
- Reconnection logic already checks sessionManager.getSession() for reuse

### TDD Process
- Verified via PM2 restart and log analysis
- No new tests; relies on existing integration behavior

### Final Outcome
DELETE /mcp now preserves session for reconnection, eliminating 400 errors on client reconnect.
