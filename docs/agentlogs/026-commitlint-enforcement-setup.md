# Commitlint Enforcement Setup

**Agent:** Haiku 4.5

## Objective
Enforce Conventional Commits with English-only enforcement via commitlint + husky. Prevent Korean/Chinese/Japanese characters in commit messages at pre-commit stage.

## Issues Identified
1. No automated commit message validation in existing hooks
2. Release workflow uses automated commits with no linting
3. Manual commits lack format enforcement, risk inconsistency
4. Future contributors might bypass conventions

## Solution: Commitlint + Husky Integration

### Implementation Steps

1. **Installed Dependencies**
   - `@commitlint/cli@20.1.0`
   - `@commitlint/config-conventional@20.0.0`

2. **Created commitlint.config.js**
   - Extended `@commitlint/config-conventional` base rules
   - Added custom `english-only` plugin rule
   - Enforces no non-ASCII characters (regex: `/[^\x00-\x7F]/`)
   - Validates commit type enum: feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert
   - Header max length: 100 chars

3. **Created .husky/commit-msg Hook**
   - Executes `commitlint --edit $1` on every commit attempt
   - Fails pre-commit if violations detected
   - Husky v9 compatible (removed deprecated shebang for v10 forward compatibility)

4. **Validated with Korean Test**
   - Attempted commit: `test: 한글 커밋 테스트`
   - Result: ✖ Correctly rejected with message: "Commit message MUST be in English only. Non-ASCII characters detected."

### Test Results
- English commits: ✅ Pass (`chore: add commitlint...`)
- Korean commits: ✅ Blocked (non-ASCII detection works)

## Key Findings
- Custom commitlint plugins work for domain-specific validation (non-ASCII check)
- Bun.YAML sufficient for workflow validation (no external yaml package needed)
- Had to rebase on latest develop (prior release workflow refactor conflicts)

## Next Steps
1. Push to remote
2. Merge enables commitlint enforcement for all future commits
