## MCP-PTY Reconnection Fix Implementation Completed

### Initial Approach
Client reconnection after session disconnect caused 400 Bad Request errors.

### Issues Identified
- Session disconnect disposed entire session including sessionId
- Reconnection created new sessionId, causing MCP protocol session mismatch
- PTYs remained undisposed, potential resource leaks

### Session Reuse Solution Adopted
Modified HTTP transport to reuse sessionId on reconnection, dispose PTYs on disconnect but preserve session.

### Implementation Details
- Updated res.on("close") to dispose PTYs but keep session in sessionManager
- Added sessionManager.getSession() check for reconnection logic
- Reconnect reuses existing sessionId, creates new transport/server instance
- Maintains session continuity while cleaning up PTY resources

### TDD Process
- No new tests added; relies on existing transport integration tests
- Verified via code review that reconnection path handles session reuse correctly

### Final Outcome
Clients can now reconnect using same sessionId without 400 errors, PTY resources properly cleaned on disconnect.
